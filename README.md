# Neighborhood-Map-React
A single-page web application, built using the React framework, that displays a Google Map of an area and various points of interest. There are a marker for each location, when selected, additional information about the location is presented from the FourSquare APIs.

Before I start coding I read some articles about the best way to using **Google Maps API** with ReactJS, follow below:
- first I found this package [react-google-maps](https://tomchentw.github.io/react-google-maps/#installation)
- I read this full article: [Google Maps with React](https://medium.com/@morgannegagne/google-maps-with-react-951c12b723ad)
- and some StackOverflow :)

## How to run the project in Development Mode
The project uses [Node.js >= 6.x](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [Create-React-App starter code](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

After Node is installed in your system, follow the below steps.

1. After cloning the app, navigate to the directory of the app.
